## Thoughts

I was always interested in implementing a light and dark theme for a project. I assumed it was going to be a lot harder than it actually was. This was done in relatively few lines of code really. I would like to try to implement this into some of my old projects as well as some upcoming ones.

I also learned about localStorage for this project. I used it once, a long time ago, when I took the 2019 Zero to Mastery Web Dev course. I took it at the beginning of the year last year and that was the last time I used it. Needless to say, I had forgotten how. I did try using it once before, somewhat recently, but I couldn't figure it out. I think now, I would be able to use it and implement it into more projects. It is not as complicated as it first seemed.
